# Cryptea

A platform for creators to receive tips from their community/fans, through Crypto.
Currently, we have added the individual username feature, where you can get paid directly using your username. This makes use of the Moralis transfer function, and the dB to pull user info

This Project was created during the Chainlink Hackathon.

## Development Process

The project makes use of a Moralis server, to store usernames, and process authentication. It also makes use of the Covalent API for On-Chain info. We used React for the Frontend development and are hosting on the Blockchain, using Spheron. The product currently supports the Polygon blockchain and uses Moralis to process the payments to creators, using Native token options.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
